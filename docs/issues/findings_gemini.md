 Based on my review of the codebase and project structure, here are the possible problems and areas of concern:

  1. Real-time Synchronization & SSE Scalability
   * Memory Leaks in SSE: The src/lib/events.ts file uses a Set<ReadableStreamDefaultController> to store active SSE connections. While there is a removeClient function, if clients disconnect
     unexpectedly without triggering the close or error events properly (common in some browser/proxy scenarios), the set could grow indefinitely, leading to memory leaks.
   * Polling vs. SSE: The GET /api/events endpoint in src/app/api/events/route.ts implements a polling-based approach (using a since parameter), while src/lib/events.ts suggests an SSE-based
     broadcast system. This duality might lead to inconsistent state updates if the frontend uses both or if they aren't perfectly synchronized.

  2. Agent Communication & WebSocket Reliability
   * OpenClaw Gateway Dependency: The system is heavily dependent on a WebSocket connection to the OpenClaw Gateway. The OpenClawClient in src/lib/openclaw/client.ts manages a complex deduplication
     cache (globalProcessedEvents) using globalThis. If this cache isn't cleared effectively across all instances or if the TTL is too long, it could consume significant memory in long-running
     processes.
   * Deduplication Collisions: The generateEventId function uses a combination of event type, sequence ID, and a hash of the payload. While robust, any bug in this hashing logic could lead to events
     being incorrectly ignored, causing agents to miss critical updates.

  3. Database & Persistence
   * SQLite for High Concurrency: The project uses SQLite with WAL mode (journal_mode = WAL). While SQLite is robust, the "Convoy Mode" executes 3–5 agents in parallel, and the "Autonomous Research"
     loop runs continuously. High write concurrency from multiple agents and background research tasks could lead to SQLITE_BUSY errors or database locking issues under heavy load.
   * Schema Migration Complexity: With over 20 migrations and a schema nearing 1,000 lines, manual schema management becomes error-prone. There is a risk of the schema.ts file falling out of sync
     with the actual migrations, potentially causing fresh installations to differ from migrated ones.

  4. Workspace Isolation
   * Port Collision Risks: Parallel build isolation depends on a workspace_ports table to manage port allocation (range 4200–4299). If an agent crashes without releasing its port, that port remains
     locked until manually cleared, potentially exhausting the port pool if many crashes occur.
   * Git Worktree Cleanup: The use of Git worktrees for isolation is powerful but requires rigorous cleanup. If the workspace-isolation.ts logic fails to remove worktrees after task completion (due
     to process crashes or filesystem locks), it could lead to significant disk space usage and cluttered repositories.

  5. Architecture & State Management
   * Next.js "force-dynamic" Overhead: Many API routes are marked as force-dynamic. While necessary for real-time data, this prevents Next.js from leveraging any caching layers, placing the entire
     load directly on the SQLite database for every request.
   * Branding Inconsistency: The project is in the middle of a branding shift to Mission Control. This is visible in the mix of "MC" prefixed variables/CSS classes and "Mission Control"
     references in documentation, which can lead to confusion for new contributors.

  6. Error Handling & Resilience
   * Cascading Failures in Convoys: In Convoy Mode, subtasks can have dependencies. If a parent task or a critical subtask fails, the cleanup and "auto-nudge" logic must be perfect to prevent
     "zombie" agents from continuing work on a doomed feature.
   * Retry Loop Exhaustion: The ideation and research cycles have retry_count fields. If the underlying AI provider (Anthropic/OpenAI) has sustained outages, the system might enter a heavy retry loop
     that consumes resources and produces excessive error logging.
